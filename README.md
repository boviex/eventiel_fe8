  Removed Spells

Replaced all Dropbox urls with relative locations

Added "Toggle Grid option"

Start Event IDs from 0x07 instead of 0x05 (just to be safe)

Reworked default settings to fit FE8 template

Hidden all options for Start/Load split

Units now work - EAStdlib needs to fix its definitions for unit helpers but workaround is ok
